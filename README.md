# Quota-Plus: A Computational Voting Mechanism for Fair Refugee Allocation

**Abstract**  
This project proposes *Quota-Plus*, a hybrid allocation mechanism that balances fairness, efficiency, and legitimacy in refugee burden-sharing.  
It builds on Arrow’s impossibility theorem, Buchanan’s insights on institutional rules, and the mechanism design framework of Hurwicz–Maskin–Myerson.
