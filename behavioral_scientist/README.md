# Behavioral Scientist

This folder contains materials for the behavioral and experimental analysis of strategic interaction in the project.

## Included Files
- **Trust_Simple otree zip** — The oTree app implementing a 2-player Trust Game.
- **human_vs_llm_results.zip** — Behavioral data comparing human and LLM decisions.

## Experimental Design
- **Platform:** [oTree](https://otree.readthedocs.io)
- **Game:** Trust Game (Trustor–Trustee)
- **Participants:** Human subjects and GPT-4 simulated agents.
- **Decision Variables:** Amount sent, amount returned, total payoff.
- **Metrics:** Trust rate, reciprocity rate, and deviation from SPNE.

## Key Insights
- Humans tend to exhibit **positive reciprocity** inconsistent with SPNE.
- LLM agents (GPT-4) replicate rational-consistent behavior but with stochastic variance.
- The result supports **Camerer (2003)** and **Fehr & Schmidt (1999)** in modeling fairness preferences.
