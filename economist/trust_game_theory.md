# Trust Game: Theoretical Analysis

## Objective
To model the strategic interaction between a trustor and a trustee under incomplete contracts.

## Model Setup
- Two players: Trustor (A) and Trustee (B)
- Payoff matrix reflecting investment, trust, and reciprocity.
- Each player maximizes expected utility given the other's strategy.

## Theoretical Tools
- **Backward Induction** to derive Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE)
- **Payoff Dominance vs. Risk Dominance**
- Fairness consideration (Fehr & Schmidt, 1999)

## Result Summary
- Rational equilibrium predicts no trust (A does not invest)
- Behavioral equilibrium (from experimental data) shows partial trust and reciprocity
