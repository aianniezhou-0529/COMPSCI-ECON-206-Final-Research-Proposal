# Welfare and Fairness Analysis

## Theoretical Foundations
- **Arrow's Impossibility Theorem (1972)** — limits of aggregating individual preferences.
- **Buchanan (1986)** — constitutional approach to welfare and collective decision-making.
- **Hurwicz–Maskin–Myerson (2007)** — mechanism design for social welfare optimization.

## Key Principles
| Concept | Definition | Implication |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Pareto Efficiency | No one can be made better off without hurting another | Benchmark for welfare comparison |
| Incentive Compatibility | Truth-telling is optimal for each agent | Ensures transparency & stability |
| Fairness | Equitable treatment across participants | Aligns with normative justice |

## Insights
- Welfare-maximizing mechanisms may conflict with fairness.
- Trade-offs between efficiency and legitimacy must be explicitly modeled.
- These insights motivate the **Quota-Plus Hybrid Mechanism** in the design section.
