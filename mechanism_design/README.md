## Contents
- `quota_plus_design.md` — Theoretical design document for the *Quota-Plus* hybrid mechanism, combining fairness, efficiency, and incentive compatibility.
- `voting_simulation.ipynb` — A simulation notebook (runnable in Google Colab) to test Quota-Plus under synthetic country data, evaluating fairness, stability, and compliance.
