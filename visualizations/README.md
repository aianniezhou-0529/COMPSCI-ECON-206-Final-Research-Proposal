# Visualizations Folder

This folder contains visual assets and demo materials for the **Quota-Plus** research project in *COMPSCI/ECON 206*.

## Contents
- **COMPSCI-ECON206_demo video.7z** — Compressed demo video showing the oTree-based experiment and simulation process.  
- **Extensive-form representation of the one-round Trust Game in GTE.png** — Game tree representation of the one-round Trust Game modeled in the GTE (Game Theory Explorer) software.  
- **Gameplay_Trust Simple using otree_step 1.png** — Step 1 of the oTree gameplay interface (Trust Game setup).  
- **Gameplay_Trust Simple using otree_step 2.png** — Step 2 of the oTree gameplay interface (player decision stage).  
- **Gameplay_Trust Simple using otree_step 3.png** — Step 3 of the oTree gameplay interface (results and payoff display).  
- **Solving Trust Simple by NashPy.png** — Nash equilibrium analysis of the Trust Game using the Python library *NashPy*.  
- **Solving the extensive-form version of Trust Simple with SPNE in GTE.png** — Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) solution visualized in GTE.  
- **Trust_Simple_payoff matrix.png** — Payoff matrix representation of the simplified Trust Game.

## Description
These visualizations illustrate both **strategic structure** and **computational analysis** of the Trust Game, a core component of the Quota-Plus mechanism’s behavioral modeling.  
They are referenced in the main report and poster to explain how human and AI agents interact in a structured decision environment.

## How to Use
- Open images directly on GitHub or download for presentation or analysis.
- The `.7z` archive contains a demonstration video (extract using 7-Zip or any compatible tool).
